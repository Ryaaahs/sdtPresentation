Key Issues in Software Maintenance
Technical Issues, Management Issues, Cost Estimation, Measurement

Should add within the slides about the rogers maintenance issue that occured

(5.2)

(2.1)Technical Issues
	

	2.1.1 Limited Understanding
	Time it takes to make a change/correction in software they did not develop
	Half of the total maintence effort is to understanding the software to be modified
	Software comprehension is key
	
	2.1.2 Testing
	The cost of testing is significant in terms of time and money
	To validate problems, the maintainer should be available to run tests to reproduce the problems
	Regression Testing: Retesting of software or a component 
	Finding time to test the application is difficult
	
	2.1.3 Impact Analysis
	Describes how to conduct, cost-effectively, a complete analysis of the impact of a change in software
	Knowledge of the application is needed to determine the risk of the change
	Change request is often called modification request (MR) or problem report (PR)
	Must be analyzed and translated into software terms
	Analyze -> Replicate Problem -> Develop options for implementing the modification
		Document MR/PR, the results, and the execution options -> obtain approval for the modification option
	The severity of the problem is often used to decide how and when it will be fixed.
	
	2.1.4 Maintainability
	Maintainability should be defined, reviewed and controlled during software development
		This is to reduce maintence costs.
	Difficult to achieve due to the subcharacteristics are not the focus during development
	Lack of documentation, Test environments
	Presence of systematic and mature processes, techniques, and tools helps to enhance the maintainability of software

(2.2) Management Issues

	2.2.1 Aligment with Organizational Objectives
	How to demostrate the return on investment with software maintenance activities.
	Ojective of extending life of the product
	Meet the demand of users and add enhancements
	The ROI is less clear, so senior management view it as a huge usage of resources
	while no clear benefit for the organzation

	2.2.2 Staffing
	Maintenance is not viewed as glamorous work and Software Maintenance personnel are view as
	"second-class citizens" and morale suffers.
	-- PERSONAL NOTE: This type of work is considered typically as cost-center
	-- Should look into these concepts

	2.2.3 Process
	Software maintenance has a set of activities methods, practices
	--NEED TO RESEARCH MORE
	
	2.2.4 Organizational aspects of maintenance
	Which org will be responsible for maintenance of software.
	The team who developed the software, doesn't always maintain it.
	The org will either stay with the original developer, or go with a permanent maintenance team

	Having a team deciacted to this:
	 	allows for specialization;
		creates communication channels;
		promotes an egoless, collegiate atmosphere;
		reduces dependency on individuals;
		allows for periodic audit checks.
	
	Given pros and cons, it should be determined on a case-by-case basis
	What is important is the delegation or assignment of the maintenance responsibility to a 
	single group or person, regardless of the organizationâ€™s structure

	2.2.5 OUtsorucing
	Outsoucing has become a major industry.
	Orgs are outsourcing entire portfolios of software, including software maintainence
	Selected for non-mission critical software 

	Main issues outsourcers face is determining the scope of the maintenance services required
	Outsourcing requires a significant initial investment and the setup of a maintenance process
	that will require automation.

(2.3) Maintenance Cost Estimation
