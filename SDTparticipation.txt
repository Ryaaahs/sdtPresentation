Key Issues in Software Maintenance
Technical Issues, Management Issues, Cost Estimation, Measurement

Should add within the slides about the rogers maintenance issue that occured

(5.2)

(2.1)Technical Issues
	

	2.1.1 Limited Understanding
	Time it takes to make a change/correction in software they did not develop
	Half of the total maintence effort is to understanding the software to be modified
	Software comprehension is key
	
	2.1.2 Testing
	The cost of testing is significant in terms of time and money
	To validate problems, the maintainer should be available to run tests to reproduce the problems
	Regression Testing: Retesting of software or a component 
	Finding time to test the application is difficult
	
	2.1.3 Impact Analysis
	Describes how to conduct, cost-effectively, a complete analysis of the impact of a change in software
	Knowledge of the application is needed to determine the risk of the change
	Change request is often called modification request (MR) or problem report (PR)
	Must be analyzed and translated into software terms
	Analyze -> Replicate Problem -> Develop options for implementing the modification
		Document MR/PR, the results, and the execution options -> obtain approval for the modification option
	The severity of the problem is often used to decide how and when it will be fixed.
	
	2.1.4 Maintainability
	Maintainability should be defined, reviewed and controlled during software development
		This is to reduce maintence costs.
	Difficult to achieve due to the subcharacteristics are not the focus during development
	Lack of documentation, Test environments
	Presence of systematic and mature processes, techniques, and tools helps to enhance the maintainability of software

(2.2) Management Issues

	2.2.1 Aligment with Organizational Objectives
	How to demostrate the return on investment with software maintenance activities.
	Ojective of extending life of the product
	Meet the demand of users and add enhancements
	The ROI is less clear, so senior management view it as a huge usage of resources
	while no clear benefit for the organzation

	2.2.2 Staffing
	Maintenance is not viewed as glamorous work and Software Maintenance personnel are view as
	"second-class citizens" and morale suffers.
	-- PERSONAL NOTE: This type of work is considered typically as cost-center
	-- Should look into these concepts

	2.2.3 Process
	Software maintenance has a set of activities methods, practices
	--NEED TO RESEARCH MORE
	
	2.2.4 Organizational aspects of maintenance
	Which org will be responsible for maintenance of software.
	The team who developed the software, doesn't always maintain it.
	The org will either stay with the original developer, or go with a permanent maintenance team

	Having a team deciacted to this:
	 	allows for specialization;
		creates communication channels;
		promotes an egoless, collegiate atmosphere;
		reduces dependency on individuals;
		allows for periodic audit checks.
	
	Given pros and cons, it should be determined on a case-by-case basis
	What is important is the delegation or assignment of the maintenance responsibility to a 
	single group or person, regardless of the organization’s structure

	2.2.5 OUtsorucing
	Outsoucing has become a major industry.
	Orgs are outsourcing entire portfolios of software, including software maintainence
	Selected for non-mission critical software 

	Main issues outsourcers face is determining the scope of the maintenance services required
	Outsourcing requires a significant initial investment and the setup of a maintenance process
	that will require automation.

(2.3) Maintenance Cost Estimation
	
	Cost is an important factor when planning software maintainenace (How many resources)
	
	2.3.1 Cost Estimation
	Affected by many techincal and non-technical factors
	IEEE 14764 (LOOK INTO IEEE 14764) states the two most popular approaches to estimating resources are 
	parametric models and use of experience

	2.3.2 Parametric Models
	Parametric cost modeling (mathematical models)
	Using historical data from previous maintenance is needed to calibrate the mathematical models
	Cost driver attributes affect the estimates.

	2.3.3 Experience
	Using "expert" judgement 
	Best approach is a combination of experience and historical data.
	The cost to conduct a modification (in terms of number of people and amount of time) is then derived		
	
	Maintenance estimation historical data should be provided as a result of a measurement 
	program

(2.4) Software Maintenance Measurement
	Entities related to software maintenance include process, resources, and product
	whose attribute can be subjected to measurement

	These measures can be derived from the maintenance process, personnel, size, complexity
	quality, understandability, maintainability, and effort

	Complexity measures can be obtain by available commerical tools -> (LOOK INTO TO)

	2.4.1 Specific Measures
	The maintainer must determine which measures are appropriate for the specific organization
	based on that organization's own context

	The software quality model suggests measures that are specific for software maintenance -> (LOOK INTO TO)
	easures for subcharacteristics of maintainability include the following
	
	• Analyzability: measures of the maintainer’s 
	effort or resources expended in trying either 
	to diagnose deficiencies or causes of failure 
	or to identify parts to be modified.

	• Changeability: measures of the maintainer’s 
	effort associated with implementing a specified modification.
	
	• Stability: measures of the unexpected behavior of software, including that encountered 
	during testing.
	
	• Testability: measures of the maintainer’s and 
	users’ effort in trying to test the modified 
	software.
	
	• Other measures that maintainers use include
	
	• size of the software,
	
	• complexity of the software ,
	
	• understandability, and
	
	• maintainability.
	
	Providing software maintenance effort, by categories, for different applications provides 
	business information to users and their organizations. It can also enable the comparison of software maintenance profiles internally within an 
	organization
